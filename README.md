# OOP school library

> Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. The app that you will create will allow a you to:

- Add new students or teachers.
- Add new books.
- Save records of who borrowed a given book and when.
> And all of this will be built in a beautiful and well-organized way! 

### Milestone 1:

- Create person class.
- Create student class that is a subclass of person class.
- Create teacher class that is a subclass of person class.

### Milestone 2:

- Create corrector class.
- Set instance of corrector in person on initialization.
- Add new method to person that validates name.

### Milestone 3:
- Create Classroom, Book and Rental classes.
- Implement several relationships between classes.

### Milestone 4:
- Create a main.rb file that will serve as your console app entry-point.
- In main.rb define the entry point, which will be a method called main that is invoked at the end of the file.
